# Idle Cat Forest fix log

This is the maintained, evidence-backed log for fixes found during design review and player-guided
or unattended playtesting. Add an entry only after the behavior, persistence boundary, relevant
Rust quality gates, and any changed Bevy visuals have been verified.

## 2026-07-14 — Finite item wear, breakage, and material-backed repair

**Problem:** Material variants had value and quality, but individual units did not complete the
DF-like condition loop: no stable unit identity, physical load pressure, work wear, broken state,
or repair action was visible to a player.

**Fix:** Every item unit now has a stable ID, weight, and finite condition. Relevant work causes
wear and zero condition leaves the item broken. Signed repair requires the appropriate completed,
staffed workshop, a living worker, and one visible matching material; durability research scales
the repair. Traders respect a 20 kg item-load cap. State survives SQLite restart.

**Player visibility and evidence:** The Goods panel shows weight, condition range,
damaged/broken counts, and a repair control. Unit, migration, determinism, denial, research,
trader-cap, protocol, signed guided, persistence, client, and accepted own-framebuffer coverage
pass. This verifies condition behavior, not full material or recipe breadth.

## 2026-07-14 — Authoritative election timing between terms

**Problem:** The governance panel could show an open election but could not answer when the next
one would begin while the colony was between terms.

**Fix:** Snapshots now carry the authoritative term start, next election boundary, term length,
and remaining duration. The governance panel renders the server-derived countdown even when no
election is open, and the schedule survives persistence/restart.

**Evidence:** Boundary, protocol, persistence, client-formatting, and integrated governance UI
coverage pass.

## 2026-07-14 — Physical Mill production and truthful local inventory

**Problem:** Grain processing could mutate aggregate resources without proving that a worker
carried inputs to an open Mill, worked there, and returned its outputs.

**Fix:** The Mill now follows the same conserved physical contract as the Sawmill: finite-store
pickup, station-local input, on-site progress, station-local output, and finite-store delivery.
Its editable queue, cargo, progress, blocked reason, and local ledgers persist through restart;
death and cancellation do not create or lose goods.

**Player visibility and evidence:** The accepted 1920×1080 own-framebuffer shows a selected open
Mill with one worker, repeating grain processing at 50%, Grain 4.0 local input, Flour 2.0 local
output, and Flour 1.5 outbound. Simulation, protocol, server, client, persistence, determinism,
and strict lint gates pass. Temporary capture fixtures and processes were removed afterward.

## 2026-07-14 — Physical shrine material offerings

**Problem:** A material offering could be credited as a scalar threshold without a cat moving
visible stockpile goods to the shrine, so the player could receive a blessing before delivery.

**Fix:** The offering is now two conserved physical stages: reserve and carry material from a
reachable visible pile into shrine escrow, then perform the ritual. Cancellation, death, blocked
routes, and restart preserve inventory exactly; credit occurs once, only after both stages.

**Evidence:** Conservation, reachability, cancellation/death, determinism, restart, and integrated
shrine-faucet campaigns pass alongside the maintained full quality gate.

## 2026-07-14 — Physical Accountant rounds and truthful stale stock reports

**Problem:** A staffed Accounting Tent refreshed the colony-wide ledger without a cat visiting
the spatial stockpiles. The client could therefore present exact authoritative quantities that no
cat had physically counted, and separate or unreachable piles had no independent freshness.

**Fix:** Accounting is now a durable physical route. An assigned tent worker returns to the tent,
visits reachable piles in deterministic distance/ID order, counts each for five game-seconds, and
returns. Only the visited pile's report changes; blocked piles remain stale, topology changes are
replanned, and cancellation never changes physical inventory. Active routes and reports persist
through SQLite restart. Existing aggregate-only saves migrate additively.

**Player visibility:** Resource HUD, Goods ledger, stockpile text, and inspectors use reported
values and mark stale estimates with `~` or `uncounted`. The Accounting Tent inspector shows the
active physical phase, target, reachable progress, and count dwell.

**Evidence:** Unit, determinism, protocol compatibility, signed server action, persistence/restart,
and client display tests pass across `cat-sim`, `cat-protocol`, `cat-server`, and `cat-client`.
The booted client/server own-framebuffer at 1920×1080 was inspected and accepted with an active
counting round and visibly stale HUD/ledger estimates.
