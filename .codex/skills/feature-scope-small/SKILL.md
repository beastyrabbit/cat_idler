# Feature Scope Small

## Goal
Select one small feature slice that is meaningful, testable, and PR-sized.

## Process
1. Inspect TODOs and clear gaps in gameplay/UI behavior.
2. Pick one slice that can be completed in a single PR.
3. Write acceptance criteria that can be tested.
4. List expected files likely to change.
5. Define out-of-scope boundaries.

## Output Format
- Feature title
- Why this matters
- Acceptance criteria
- Candidate files
- Out of scope
