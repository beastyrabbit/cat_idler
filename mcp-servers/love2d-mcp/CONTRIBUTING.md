### Making Changes

#### TypeScript/MCP Server Changes

- Server code is in `src/index.ts`
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Ensure proper error handling for TCP connections
- Test with the example game after changes

#### Lua Bridge Changes

- Bridge code is in `game/mcp_bridge.lua`
- Keep the API simple and well-documented
- Ensure non-blocking socket operations
- Test JSON encoding/decoding thoroughly

#### Example Game Changes

- Game code is in `game/main.lua`
- Keep it simple and illustrative
- Demonstrate MCP capabilities clearly

## Code Style

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `async/await` over callbacks
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Follow existing formatting

### Lua

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

Before submitting a PR, verify:

- [ ] Game starts without errors
- [ ] MCP server connects to game successfully
- [ ] `list_objects` returns correct data
- [ ] `get_object` retrieves object details
- [ ] `run_lua` executes code correctly
- [ ] Error handling works (try invalid commands)
- [ ] Game and server shut down cleanly

### Testing New Features

- Add example usage in PR description
- Update documentation if needed
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Submitting Changes
